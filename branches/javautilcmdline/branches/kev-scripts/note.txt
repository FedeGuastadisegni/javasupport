Updates to javautil-2.1.1

What I did:
- Created utility scripts
	runjava		UNIX
	runjava.bat	Windows / DOS
  These scripts contain the vast bulk of the other scripts
  
  All the other scripts were updated to use these utility scripts

Space savings

187,023 (182.6 KB)  Original
 10,048 (  9.8 KB)  After createing runjava and runjava.bat and shortening other scripts
-------
176,975 (172.8 KB)  space saved

Files
  list           List of lines from *.bat (see mklist.bat)
  mklist.bat     Create the file/Java Class list using grep

  mkscripts.awk  Awk script to read list and generate new batch/script files
  mkunix.awk     Awk script to create alternate UNIX script
                 This awk script creates an 'all' UNIX script and outputs
			     sh links to create links from the actuall scripts to 
			     this script.  This would further save space, but only
			     works on systems that support lines
