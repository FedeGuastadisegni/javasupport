#summary A command line utilities toolboxes

= Command Line Tools =

You should able to run many utilities with a wrapper scripts like this:

{{{
$ toolbox/bin/run.sh toolbox.SearchJars MyClass /path/to/some/jarfiles.
}}}

Download the package and see what tools are available. All tools should support --help option for more details.


= Template Generator =

I added some Groovy templates that can help generate/scaffold a SpringMVC webapp with Model/Dao, Controller, and View.

There is also a simple Authentication template sets that work with user.User model.

Example:
{{{
$ cd into your maven project
$ toolbox/bin/generate-springmvc.sh scaffold com.mycompany.demo.user.User username, password
}}}
